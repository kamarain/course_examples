## Mouse tracker
The idea of this project is to study very basics of robot control. Our "robot" is a little virtual wagon that tries to catch the mouse pointer that user moves on the screen. We move from simple but unrealistic wagon toward more complicated but more realistic system - a system that could be actually build.
